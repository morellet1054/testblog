A successful amphibious invasion of this magnitude had never been accomplished before, nor has it been since. While the bravery, savvy and prowess of Anglo-allied forces in this invasion were unmatched, it is the strategic intelligence operations under the code name Bodyguard, which preceded and continued after June 6 that ultimately actualized the breach of Hitler’s Atlantic Wall and reoccupation of France. This paper will examine how Operation Bodyguard and its subordinate operations expertly manipulated Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, resulting in a military intelligence operation so remarkable that it has earned its place in history as a case study for strategic deception.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operation Bodyguard: Summary</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Operation Overlord, the allied invasion of Europe, faced the incredibly monstrous task of landing a relatively small force somewhere along the Atlantic Wall, which covered 1,670 miles of French and Belgian coastline running from Norway to the Spanish Border. Over 100 armored, infantry and fortress divisions were deployed there to protect Nazi-occupied Europe from the inevitable Allied invasion.<span class="s1">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The success of Operation Overlord hinged on Operation Bodyguard, a massive umbrella deception operation with the goal of diverting Axis reinforcements from Normandy. The two main missions of Bodyguard were “(1) to fix German forces in areas away from the actual invasion sites; (2) to convince the Germans that Normandy was only a feint or demonstration for the real invasion that was to occur several weeks later.”<span class="s1">2</span> Bodyguard consisted of numerous division operations, the most comprehensive being Operation Fortitude and Operation Zeppelin. Fortitude signaled a threat to Norway and a threat to Pas De Calais,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Intelligence%20Research%20Paper%20Tinsley_files/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s2">1</span> Timothy Smith, “Overlord/Bodyguard: Intelligence Failure through Adversary Deception,” <i>International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence </i>27, no. 3 (12 May 2014): 551.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2<span class="s3"> Major Jon S.

It was closest to Allied positions in England and controlling a port would be useful for moving reinforcement troops and resources into France behind the initial attack. This rational assessment convinced Nazi military leaders, and notably the military Führer (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, OKW), that the Anglo-Allied military would take this course, and that if any deception operation were to take place, it would be a feint invasion of Normandy beaches.<span class="s1">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Because of the “double-cross” network’s extensive intelligence on the German military actions, and Ultra, the Anglo-Allies were well aware of this. Operations Bodyguard and Overlord were then planned accordingly, capitalizing on the adversary’s own biases. However, they knew that Hitler was a paranoid man and that it would take an airtight deception to pull off both Overlord and Bodyguard. In other words, the allies didn’t plant these perceptions of their intentions, they were already there. The goal of Bodyguard was to reinforce them with so much vigor that the Nazis would confidently commit to defending these positions with personnel and resources.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Double-Cross” System</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">A nation at war uses strategic intelligence to identify strengths and vulnerabilities of its adversaries. This information is usually collected using technical means or human intelligence (HUMINT), it then contributes to war strategy decisions. In the case of the British Security Service’s (M15) “Double- Cross” System, they employed the use of both HUMINT and COMINT to diffuse information about Bodyguard to the Germans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Intelligence%20Research%20Paper%20Tinsley_files/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">3<span class="s3"> Smith, “Overlord/Bodyguard,” 553.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">4<span class="s3"> Ibid, 551.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">In the beginning of the war, M15 set out to completely dispel the German intelligence (Abwehr) network in the UK. To do this, they employed the Aliens Registration Act, to interview all foreigners on the island and eventually identify Abwehr agents who were operating within their borders.<span class="s1">5</span> In 1940, Hitler ordered Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr, to build a sophisticated network of agents in the UK to supply Berlin with inside information throughout the war. At that time, Canaris had not admitted that the entirety of his force had been identified and captured by the M15. With a short deadline, he sent in insufficiently trained and unprepared agents to fulfil his orders. The haphazard nature of these new spies from their identifications to their clothing made them easy targets for M15 identification.<span class="s1">6</span> Instead of executing or imprisoning them, however, the M15 decided to employ them as double agents. This was the beginning of an intricate program of German agents in Britain who were used to “double-cross” the Abwehr and feed false intelligence to the German military.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Once this system was put in place, M15 worked closely with the Secret Intelligence Service (M16) to transmit intelligence directly to the Abwehr. To maintain the reliability of their double agents, verified information about allied forces was transmitted to the Abwehr alongside misinformation to support deception campaigns.<span class="s1">7</span> For the entirety of the war, the “double-cross” system was one of the most valuable weapons for the Anglo-Allies, and eventually became paramount to Operation Bodyguard.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Of the many reinforcement techniques used to safeguard the “double-cross” system and monitor German activities was the Ultra program. This British codebreaking operation of the German Enigma cipher system allowed allied intelligence to collect Nazi COMINT not only on perceptions of the credibility of the Abwehr double agents in the UK but also of Allied strategy.<span class="s1">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">In his article, “Overlord/Bodyguard: Intelligence Failure through Adversary Deception,” Timothy Smith outlines factors of deception which are necessary for the success of an operation like Bodyguard. They will be used throughout the paper to further analyze the different divisions of the Allied deception operation. To begin with, Smith identifies two forms which deception can take: “ambiguity increasing (A-Type)” and “misleading (M-Type).”<span class="s1">9</span> “A-Type deception must present credible and consequential threats. The resulting ambiguity can induce the target to postpone final assessment and appropriate reaction. M-Type then reduces ambiguity, inducing the target to select from among the alternative contingencies</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Intelligence%20Research%20Paper%20Tinsley_files/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">5<span class="s3"> Whitney Bendeck, “The Art of Deception: Dueling Intelligence Organizations in World War II” (M.A. Thesis, The Florida State University, 2004), 19.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6<span class="s3"> Bendeck, “The Art of Deception,” 20.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">7<span class="s3"> Ibid, 28.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8<span class="s3"> Smith, “Overlord/Bodyguard,” 553.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9<span class="s3"> Smith, “Overlord/Bodyguard,” 554.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the one most beneficial to the deceiver.”<span class="s5">9 </span>The “double-cross” system contributes to this M-Type form of deception, wherein the steady stream of intelligence from the double agents reinforces the alternate operations, making them seem verifiable, thereby decreasing ambiguity and pushing the Germans to focus on Norway, Pas de Calais and the Balkans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operation Fortitude</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Operation Fortitude was contrived to create the aforementioned A-Type deceptions in order to put the Germans off of Operation Neptune, the invasion of Normandy beaches. The operation included Fortitude North, a fictitious plan of an allied invasion of Norway, and Fortitude South, the diversion created by the threat of an invasion at Pas de Calais. The operation depended heavily on decoy forces as well as bogus HUMINT, COMINT and IMINT to share plans for the feint strategy to the Germans. The final goal of Operation Fortitude was to convince the Germans that, should there be an invasion at Normandy, that it would itself be a diversion from the invasions further North. This was key to the success of Neptune, and of Overlord in the long run.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s6">Fortitude North</span>. As aforementioned, Fortitude North focused on a notional invasion of Norway, which was a source of insecurity for Hitler for a couple of reasons. The threat of the Allies occupying Norway had implications on Swedish neutrality, which was essential to the German military because most of their iron ore was supplied by Sweden. Furthermore, the German naval commanders depended on Nordic positions in their plans for war with the British Navy. <span class="s1">10</span> The final nail in the coffin was the threat of Allied access to invade Germany via Denmark should they capture Norway. Knowing that Hitler was so paranoid about the northern flank made Fortitude North the perfect feint operation to draw attention from Normandy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">In order to capitalize on Hitler’s insecurity about Norway, plans for Fortitude North were based on creating decoy forces and then communicating this misinformation to the Germans. A 4<span class="s1">th</span> British Army was imagined and then</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“stationed” in Scotland, to create the illusion that they were preparing to invade Norway. This “army” was supported by decoy tanks and landing vessels, and all of this information was communicated to the Germans through the “double-cross” system, accompanied by fake wireless communications of the Allied preparations.<span class="s1">11</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Intelligence%20Research%20Paper%20Tinsley_files/Image_004.png"/></span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s2">10</span> Donal J. Sexton, “Phantoms of the North: British Deceptions in Scandinavia, 1941-1944,” <i>Military Affairs </i>47, no. 3, (October 1983), 109.</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11<span class="s3"> Bendeck, “The Art of Deception,” 30-31.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">These wireless communications highlight one of the most important factors in deception, according to Smith, that “In addition to protecting the truth by denying the target information on actual operational capabilities and intentions, deception requires secrecy concerning the deception operation itself.”<span class="s1">12</span> In terms of Operation Fortitude, this included completely concealing information about the verity of the operation, while also flawlessly communicating the cover-story in a way that wasn’t too obvious to the Germans. Therefore, they had to study genuine communications of this type in order to emulate them, while simultaneously going through the motions of “protecting” the communications sufficiently so that the Germans wouldn’t catch on. Pulling off such a largescale communication of falsified information speaks to why Operation Bodyguard is so revered as best in its class of deception operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">This deception caused Hitler to reinforce his positions in Norway with over 450,000 troops, a Panzer division and a large air force. All of these resources were then tied up far north of Normandy Beach.<span class="s1">13</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fortitude South. <span class="p">The sister Operation Fortitude South was focused on confirming the German expectation of an initial attack on Pas de Calais. For reasons discussed above, the German military were under the impression that it would make the most sense for the Allies to attack there. Hitler preparing for the invasion at Pas de Calais not only diverted powerful defenses from Normandy, but also created the opportunity to play the primary Operation Neptune off as merely a diversion effort. According to Fortitude South, the real continental invasion would come at Pas de Calais some weeks after the initial attack on Normandy.</span><span class="s1">14</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The latter deception was more important to the invasion than it seemed. First of all, the guise that a Normandy invasion would take place as a diversion tactic allowed the Allied military to build up forces close to Nazi occupied France, as it would’ve been virtually impossible to conceal these efforts from Abwehr IMINT. Second of all, the ruse kept Hitler from sending reinforcements to Normandy immediately after the invasion, because he was so convinced that the main invasion at Pas de Calais was forthcoming. Fortitude North and Fortitude South ensured that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“powerful German combat forces, capable of smashing an invasion, were fixed out of place for several weeks. German forces north of the Seine, away from the actual landing sites, were actually stronger in July than they had been on D-Day, one month prior.”<span class="h2">Error!

Patton. This imaginary force was invented to corroborate the threat to the Germans, and choosing a general that they respected and feared, was necessary to their belief that Pas de Calais was the primary invasion. While the decoy forces and IMINT were a huge part of the Fortitude South deception, in retrospect, captured documents revealed that wireless communications and messages about FUSAG from M15’s double agents had the most direct influence on German strategy.<span class="s1">15</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Smith highlights “plausibility, confirmation, and gravity”<span class="s1">16</span> as further important factors of deception theory. This is where the Allies really excelled in Bodyguard. In the example of Fortitude South, the plausibility of the plan already existed in the minds of the Germans, all they had to do was confirm it, using FUSAG, COMINT and HUMINT from the double-cross agents. The gravity was supplied by their choice of General Patton as the leader of the army. While Patton preferred a direct combat position,<span class="s7">15</span><span class="s8"> </span>his role in Fortitude South was paramount to the Germans believing that Pas de Calais was under the biggest threat.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The choice of General Patton to lead FUSAG speaks to another important theme of Bodyguard, which is a genuine and comprehensive understanding of the adversary. Knowing that Patton was an essential enough component to the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">German’s perception of FUSAG, and of Fortitude South, to use him there instead of in Neptune shows not only the breadth of their understanding of the OKW, but also of their commitment to deception. The deep penetration of the high command of the German military thanks to the “double-cross” system and Ultra made this understanding a possibility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operation Zeppelin</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Operation Zeppelin was the code name for the ruse in the Balkans by the notional British 12<span class="s1">th</span> Army in the Middle East. This operation again draws on the psychological warfare at play here, as the Allies knew Hitler was particularly paranoid about his southern flank. The Axis military depended on allies in the Balkan region for both manpower and oil.<span class="s7">13</span><span class="s8"> </span>For this reason, the Anglo-Allies knew that Hitler would prioritize protecting the southern flank and divert forces from Normandy beaches in order to do so.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The Germans did just that, and the Desert Fox, field Marshal Erwin Rommel, was sent south to counter this “threat.” Although Rommel returned to the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Intelligence%20Research%20Paper%20Tinsley_files/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15<span class="s3"> Bendeck, “The Art of Deception,” 34.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16<span class="s3"> Smith, “Overlord/Bodyguard,” 556.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Atlantic Wall after nothing transpired in the Balkans, the diversion thwarted the timing of reinforcements at Normandy. Furthermore, the Balkan defense was made up of reserves from the Atlantic Wall, “so the Panzer Lehr Division, 2 SS Panzer Corps, and an additional infantry division were taken out of France and sent” there.<span class="s7">13</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">Here again, the deep penetration of German military decision makers allowed the Allies to contrive a deception so plausible to the Germans that they would actually act on the feinted threat. All of the factors that went into this deception allowed it to accomplish its end goal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;">The Allied invasion of Normandy beaches on 6 June 1944 was absolutely extraordinary. From the sheer numbers of forces that made up such a long-distance amphibious attack, to the logistical detail that went into launching the continental invasion, Neptune itself was one of kind. The sacrifice and cost incurred at D-Day will never go unrecognized. That being said, the above discussion of Operation Bodyguard and its multiple deception operations demonstrate what could’ve been waiting for Allied Forces on the beaches that day, and how much they could’ve changed the outcome of Operation Overlord, and ultimately, the outcome of the war.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">The British value of and investment in intelligence was ahead of its time.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The expert use of “organizational management; deep intelligence penetration; plausibility; confirmation;… and the target’s predispositions”<span class="s5">12 </span>made this deception possible. The overall success of Bodyguard hinged on innumerable Allied efforts which altogether changed the course of history.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 198pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Bibliography</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: left;">Bendeck, Whitney “The Art of Deception: Dueling Intelligence Organizations in World War II.” M.A. Thesis, The Florida State University, 2004.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -36pt;text-align: left;">Gentry, John A. “Intelligence in war: how important is it?
