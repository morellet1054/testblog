In my last paper, I argued that humor and satire in The New Yorker make hard hitting journalism more palatable for its readers, therefore increasing its overall influence on society. In this paper, I will examine when and how satire fails, and the impact that it has on society when it does. For example, is a joke ever really just a joke? Is it safe to let your audience interpret your work? What happens when they misinterpret it? Selective perception and exposure, self-enhancement perception and social dominance orientation explain why The New Yorker is not immune to misinterpretation, and why that devalues the use of humor and satire to critique society.\nTo begin, Cooks & Orbe provide a straightforward look at problems that can arise when open ended jokes invite their audience to interpret their meaning. “Beyond the satire: Selective exposure and selective perception in”In Living Color,\" studied focus groups’ responses to disparaging jokes in the popular sketch comedy show “In Living Color.” They hypothesized, and then proved, that different groups of people perceived jokes in the show differently, and then identified why that was happening. The show depicts different minority groups in America in a way that satirizes stereotypes and stereotyping. Through their study, Cooks & Orbe found that satire in the show was more harmful than productive to society for the following reasons. First, it perpetuated negative stereotypes, focus groups also found that this could be harmful for young children watching the show. They also pointed out that non-minorities might not be able to decipher the difference between reality and parody in some of the jokes. The study also pointed out that a lack of positive depictions of minorities in other popular media made disparaging jokes about minorities more harmful than jokes about other groups (Cooks & Orbe 227-229). The selective exposure and perception hypotheses apply to each of the examples analyzed below from The New Yorker.\nLaMarre et. Al found that polarization is another important negative impact that satire can have on society. In their study, “The Irony of Satire: Political Ideology and the Motivation to See What You Want to See in The Colbert Report,” LaMarre et. Al explain how the selective perception of humor and satire can deepen social chasms. Their argument is similar to the selective perception discussed by Cooks & Orbe but applies to the social dominance theory. According to LaMarre et. Al, different perceptions are based on individual social needs for self-enhancement. In other words, people will perceive and share humor and satire in ways that will be well received by the social or political group that they are a part of, in order to increase their social status as a part of said group. Therefore, “individuals with strong political ideologies may be motivated by their social self (as defined by Brewer 1991) to process ambiguous information in a way that favors their political beliefs and/or political groups who hold similar beliefs and opinions” (LaMarre et. Al 214).\nA collection of cartoons by Ward Sutton entitled “Some Initial Proposals for Trump Monuments” from The New Yorker can help explain LaMarre et. Al’s polarization conclusion. The first cartoon in the series suggest a “Super-Soaker Spreader” monument: “A giant Sprinkler Designed to Spray Water Tainted with Infectious Disease.” The cartoon depicts a bust of the Statue of Liberty wearing a bikini top and holding a copy of Art of the Deal. The torch in her raised right-hand acts as a sprinkler, spraying water droplets and cartoon virus particles on Kayleigh McEnany, Stephen Miller and Chris Christie, who all contracted the COVID-19 virus at a super spreader event hosted by the President at the White House earlier this year.\nWhile the cartoon is intended to satirize President Trump’s gross mismanagement of the Coronavirus pandemic, according to LaMarre et. Al, “there are stark differences in how [different social/political groups] see the comedy, who they think is being satirized, and how those differences polarize the electorate by reinforcing their own set of beliefs as valid and the opposing set of beliefs as laughable” (LaMarre et. Al 226). In using humor to satirize somber, life or death failures of the president and his administration, these cartoons allow members of conservative social groups to use the jokes to their own advantage as well. By selective perception, members of certain social groups could interpret the cartoon in a way that aligns with the general consensus of said group. For example, they might laugh along with President Trump, seeing the cartoon as a satire on trivial matters that have been dramatized in the media to demonize him. The further danger is that groupthink can then reinforce a certain interpretation and write off another interpretation as ludicrous, contributing to political polarization in society. As exemplified by this cartoon, the ability of satire to perpetuate social-political polarization can make it dangerous to society.\nIn their study, “A Joke is Just a Joke (Except When It Isn’t): Cavalier Humor Beliefs (CHB) Facilitate the Expression of Group Dominance Motives,” Hodson et. Al describe how CHB can serve as an excuse for social dominance oriented (SDO) people to laugh at disparaging jokes against less dominant social groups (660). The study defines CHB as a \"lighthearted, less serious, uncritical, and nonchalant approach toward humor that dismisses potential harm to others (Hodson et. Al 660). By claiming that one has CHB, they more freely express their social dominance motives, or their inherent preference for jokes which reestablish their own social dominance over others (Hodson et. Al 677). This conclusion is important because it signals that jokes have the power to reenforce social hierarchies. CHB provide a sort of buffer for an audience to attribute their enjoyment of a joke to the fact that they do not think humor should be taken seriously, when in reality they are laughing because they are subconsciously enjoying their social dominance.\nConsidering Hodson et. Al’s findings, the depiction of the Obamas as terrorists in the July 21, 2008 cover of The New Yorker entitled “The Politics of Fear,” raises a number of issues. First, there is the issue of those people who enjoy the joke because it underlines the position that society has attributed to the presidential candidate and his wife based on the color of their skin. On top of that, claiming to have CHB as a way to excuse the obvious racial religious and social prejudices which play into the “humor” of this joke makes it even more lethal. On the other hand, there are people who support the Obamas, or who belong to a social outgroup being depicted in the cover, who might still find the cover humorous for its intended satire on the ridiculousness of the prejudiced claims being made against the Obamas at the time. This group could claim to have CHB as well, and although their laughter seems altruistic, subconsciously the harmful depiction of the former President and First Lady is internalized, both individually and by society as a whole.\n“Humor, Judgements as a Function of Reference groups and Identification Classes,” by Lawrence La Fave further qualifies the previous conclusions from Hodson et. Al. The chapter analyzes studies about how effective reference groups (RGs) and identification classes (ICs) are in predicting someone’s amusement at a particular “joke” (La Fave 197-198). La Fave sets out to explore the question of whether anyone really has a “sense of humor,” and in doing this he addresses the social dominance theory as a huge part of an individual’s experience of a “joke” as funny or unfunny. He used the same method of experimentation to prove through multiple examples that someone’s relationship to RGs and ICs in particular can predict how they will receive a “joke.” For example, “pro-male” males found disparaging jokes about females funnier, while “pro-female” females found “jokes” funnier when they were making fun of males (La Fave 205). This finding qualifies Hodson et. Al’s discussions of social dominance theory and humor because it exemplifies how strongly the two are correlated. If it is proven that reference groups and identification classes play into humor so much so that they can accurately predict how someone will respond to a “joke,” then writing any disparaging joke about an outgroup has major social implications.\nA series of cartoons by Natalya Lobanova, published in the most recent issue of The New Yorker entitled, “My Life in Different Decades,” depicts cartoons of stereotypical women from decades past. Alongside each depiction of a white woman dressed in period clothing is a bulleted list of stereotypes that were attributed to women at that time. For the purposes of using this example, I am not going to address the problematic use of white experiences as a generalization of the female experience throughout history but will focus instead on predicting how the “joke/s” in question could be received by different genders. To do this, the subject of the joke must be identified, and these cartoons are slightly more complicated than the jokes used in La Fave’s study. The intended subject of Lobanova’s joke is the patriarchal society which has oppressed women for centuries. However, Cooks & Orbe’s findings on selective perception suggest that people will see what they want to see in the cartoon over what is actually there. Therefore, it is possible that “pro-male” males would perceive the “joke” as an accurate depiction of female performance in society throughout history, rather than a critique of a society which rigidly defined insufficient gender roles. At the intersection of Cooks & Orbe’s and La Fave’s work, these cartoons could provide an example of not only how RGs (male vs female) can predict how different groups could enjoy the “jokes,” but also how they perceive them. In this particular case, according to the findings of Cooks & Orbe as well as La Fave, “pro-female” females may find the “joke” entertaining as a critique on society, while “pro-male” males might find it amusing as a critique on female performance in society. These cartoons display La Fave’s conclusion that social dominance accurately depicts a joke’s reception, so if it is clear that disparaging humor is propping up rigid social hierarchies which are based on historical racism and patriarchy, then is it possible to use satire in a way that isn’t harmful to society?\nWhile The New Yorker remains an iconic publication with the platform to critique American society, the examples above make satire’s vulnerabilities unavoidable regardless of the medium in which it is presented. Selective exposure and perception, self-enhancement and social dominance orientation, as explained above, all point out that the ambiguous nature of satirical humor opens a door for misinterpretation. Whether it concerns a controversy that makes headlines, or weekly cartoons, satire has the power to reinforce negative stereotypes and social hierarchies both explicitly and implicitly. Further research on this topic could hopefully elucidate practices to help mediate the risks that misinterpretations of satire pose to society as a whole.\n \nWorks Cited\nBlitt, Barry. “The Politics of Fear.” Cover.
