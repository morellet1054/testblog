*George Washington University Class of 2021, B.A. in International Affairs, minor in Journalism and Mass Communications*

My name is Morelle Tinsley and I am a graduating senior at the George Washington University! In my Digital Reporting class, we have been learning to code in RStudio all semester. For my final project, I created my own personal website using Distill and netlify, and that is what you see here. Take a look around my site to find out more about how I learned to use Rstudio to find stories in numbers and data sets. In addition, you will find writing samples from coursework I have completed in both International Security Policy and Journalism, as well as a little bit more about who I am and what I do.
